# Data cleaning pipeline and self-updated database


##### Welcome to this project! My main goal is to build a data pipeline that updates a database on an excel file of an anonymous company while automatically cleaning the data that is being fed into it.


###### Side note: Yes, this is displayed in a jupyter notebook so you can visualize and test things by yourself easily. But if this code was designed in such way that if it is saved as a python script and executed it will do its job ;)
