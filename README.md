# Data cleaning pipeline and self-updated database


##### Welcome to this project! My main objective is build an data pipeline that updates an excel database of an anonymus company   that I am capable of cleaning and processing data by myself, but to prove that I can write production-ready quality scripts that can be deployed into production. It doesn't  matter if the inputs contain different data and contains more data than it this example, this code should take care of it and can be modified easily to solve bugs and to deal with unexpected data.

###### Side note: Yes, this is displayed in a jupyter notebook so you can visualize and test things by yourself easily. But if this code was designed in such way that if it is saved as a python script and executed it will do its job ;)
